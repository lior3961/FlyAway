# FlyAway - AI-Powered Holiday Planning Platform

## Overview

FlyAway is an intelligent holiday planning platform that leverages Artificial Intelligence to create personalized travel recommendations. Designed to make trip planning effortless, the application helps users discover vacation destinations tailored to their preferences and provides smart, accurated travel plans.

The platform uses advanced natural language processing through OpenAI's technology to understand user preferences and generate personalized travel suggestions. By analyzing factors such as budget constraints, preferred activities, climate preferences, and travel duration, FlyAway creates tailored itineraries that match each user's unique requirements.

Additionally, FlyAway leverages user-generated travel reviews from our database to provide more authentic and experience-based recommendations.

- Accommodation suggestions that align with preferences
- User reviews and ratings from past travelers
- Detailed daily scheduling for the first week of travel

The application follows a user-centered design approach, providing an intuitive interface that guides travelers through the planning process from inspiration to finalized itinerary.
The design allows the end-user to improve the AI recommendation according to his notes from time to time, ensuring satisfaction.
